### Unit III: Probabilistic Retrieval and Language Modeling

This unit introduces two major approaches to information retrieval: probabilistic retrieval and language models.

1. **Probabilistic Retrieval**:
   - **Basic Probability Theory**: Fundamental probability concepts, such as likelihood and conditional probability, which are essential in ranking documents by relevance.
   - **Probability Ranking Principle (PRP)**: A principle that says the best way to rank documents is to order them by their probability of relevance to the user's query.
      - **1/0 Loss Case**: Considers only correct and incorrect (binary) retrieval.
      - **PRP with Retrieval Costs**: Includes the cost of retrieving documents, aiming to minimize retrieval errors and costs.
   - **Binary Independence Model (BIM)**: Assumes that terms in documents are independent, and each term's occurrence is either relevant or irrelevant.
   - **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how often a term appears in a document. It’s often combined with other factors to evaluate document relevance.
   - **Extensions and Variants**:
     - **Tree-Structured Dependencies**: Considers relationships between terms.
     - **Okapi BM25**: A popular model that scores relevance based on term frequency, length, and other factors.
     - **Bayesian Networks**: Uses probability networks to assess relevance.
     - **Relevance Feedback**: Improves ranking based on feedback about which documents were relevant.
     - **Field Weights and BM25F**: Weighs terms differently based on their fields (title, body) in documents.

2. **Language Models for Information Retrieval**:
   - **Generating Queries from Documents**: Models that simulate the process of generating user queries from the documents’ content.
   - **Language Models**: Mathematically represent how words or phrases occur in documents. This includes:
     - **Finite Automata**: Models with states to predict word sequences.
     - **Types of Language Models**: For different tasks in IR.
     - **Multinomial Distributions**: Used to assign probabilities to word occurrences.
   - **Ranking with Language Models**: Orders documents by their similarity to user queries.
   - **Divergence from Randomness**: Measures how much a document deviates from random text to judge relevance.
   - **Passage Retrieval and Ranking**: Retrieves relevant passages instead of whole documents.

**Case Study**: A comparative study of probabilistic and language models for information retrieval.

This should provide a foundational understanding of each concept in Units III to VI in a simplified format. Let me know if you need more detail on any specific 






. To complete each of these tasks, here’s an overview of the main concepts and techniques that can be used for implementation. Each task touches on core areas of machine learning, information retrieval, text processing, and graph algorithms, requiring a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical programming skills.

### 1. **Text Document Pre-Processing: Stop Word Removal and Stemming**
   - **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminate common words (like "the," "is," "in") that don't add meaningful context to text processing. You can use libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, or a custom stop word list.
   - **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" to "run"). Stemming removes suffixes, while lemmatization maps words to dictionary forms. Libraries like NLTK and SpaCy have built-in stemmers and lemmatizers.
   - **Other Pre-Processing Steps**:
     - Lowercasing: Standardizes text by converting all characters to lowercase.
     - Tokenization: Splits text into individual words or tokens.
     - Punctuation Removal: Strips out punctuation that may not contribute to analysis.

### 2. **Document Retrieval Using Inverted Files**
   - **Inverted Indexing**: This data structure maps terms to their locations in documents, making it efficient for keyword-based retrieval.
   - **Index Construction**: Build an inverted index that associates each word (or token) with a list of document identifiers where it appears.
   - **Tokenization and Normalization**: Tokenize and normalize words before indexing to ensure consistency.
   - **Query Processing**: Use Boolean or vector space models to process queries. Boolean retrieval allows for keyword matching, while vector models use term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for relevance.
   - **Implementing in Python**: Python’s dictionary structures are well-suited for inverted indexes, and libraries like NLTK can aid in pre-processing.

### 3. **Constructing a Bayesian Network for Medical Diagnosis (Heart Disease Dataset)**
   - **Bayesian Networks**: Directed acyclic graphs where nodes represent variables, and edges denote probabilistic dependencies. Useful for probabilistic inference.
   - **Heart Disease Dataset**: This dataset typically includes features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc., with labels indicating heart disease presence.
   - **Learning Parameters**: Calculate conditional probability tables for each node. In Python, libraries like PyMC3 or pgmpy can handle parameter learning.
   - **Inference**: Use Bayesian inference for diagnostics. Probabilistic reasoning allows estimation of the likelihood of heart disease given a patient's symptoms.
   - **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features for building the network, as some attributes may have stronger predictive power.
   - **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the network's diagnostic ability.

### 4. **E-mail Spam Filtering Using Text Classification**
   - **Text Classification**: Categorize text data (emails) as spam or not spam.
   - **Bag-of-Words (BOW) and TF-IDF**: Represent text in numerical format. BOW counts word occurrences, while TF-IDF adjusts for term relevance across documents.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Use pre-processing techniques like stop word removal, stemming, and tokenization to create features.
   - **Classification Algorithms**:
     - Naive Bayes: Common for spam filtering due to its efficiency and strong baseline performance.
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Random Forest: Other ML models that can handle text classification.
   - **Data Set**: Use a spam dataset like the Enron Spam dataset or the SpamAssassin dataset.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, and precision-recall metrics.

### 5. **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**
   - **Clustering Concepts**: Group similar data points into clusters based on a distance or similarity measure (e.g., Euclidean distance).
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: An unsupervised technique where each data point starts as its own cluster, and clusters are iteratively merged based on similarity.
   - **Agglomerative vs. Divisive Clustering**: Agglomerative clustering starts with individual data points and merges them, while divisive clustering splits data iteratively.
   - **Linkage Methods**:
     - Single-link: Merges clusters based on the shortest distance between any two points in different clusters.
     - Complete-link: Considers the maximum distance.
     - Average-link: Uses the average distance.
   - **Dendrogram**: Visual representation of the hierarchical structure of clusters, showing merges at each level.
   - **Implementing in Python**: Use libraries like SciPy or Scikit-learn, which offer hierarchical clustering functions.

### 6. **PageRank Algorithm Implementation**
   - **PageRank Algorithm**: Measures the importance of web pages based on link structure, with the idea that more links from high-importance pages increase a page’s importance.
   - **Graph Representation**: Use nodes for pages and directed edges for hyperlinks.
   - **Transition Probability Matrix**: Each link from a page represents a probability of moving to another page, influenced by factors like damping factor (typically set to 0.85).
   - **Iterative Computation**: The algorithm uses an iterative process to update PageRank values until convergence.
   - **Libraries**:
     - NetworkX in Python: Useful for graph representation and manipulation.
     - BeautifulSoup: Helpful for web scraping to gather data and build graphs.
   - **Evaluating Convergence**: Stop the iterative process when PageRank values converge (difference below a threshold).

Each of these implementations can benefit from a mix of theory and coding knowledge, and Python libraries like NLTK, Scikit-learn, and NetworkX will be highly beneficial. These programs are applicable to a range of data science and machine learning applications, from natural language processing to graph theory and probabilistic inference.
